## Usage

To use SimpleChatBot, simply run the main.py file in a Python environment or just click the start.bat

Here are some examples of things you can say to the chatbot:

- help: displays a list of available commands and their descriptions
- translate [text] to [language]: Translates the given text to the specified language
- math [expression]: Calculates the given mathematical expression
- day: Provides information on the current day
- time: Provides information on the current time
- weather: Provides weather information for the specified location
- bye: Exits the chatbot
        
Additionally, each command has alternative phrasings that can be used to trigger the corresponding action
For example, instead of typing 'time', you can ask 'What time is it?' and the chatbot will provide the current time

To use the weather feature, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeather. Once you have obtained the key, you can add it to your ```config.py``` file under ```WEATHER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'```
